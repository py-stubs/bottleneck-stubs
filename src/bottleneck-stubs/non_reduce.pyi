    Ranks the data, dealing with ties appropriately.

    Equal values are assigned a rank that is the average of the ranks that would have been otherwise assigned to all of the values within that set.

    Ranks begin at 1, not 0.

    ### Parameters:

        aarray_like
            Input array.
            If a is not an array, a conversion is attempted.
        axis{int, None}, optional
            Axis along which the elements of the array are ranked.
            The default (axis=None) is to rank the elements of the flattened array.

    ### Returns:
            An array with the same shape as a. The dtype is float64.

    Ranks the data, dealing with ties and NaNs appropriately.

    Equal values are assigned a rank that is the average of the ranks that would have been otherwise assigned to all of the values within that set.

    NaNs in the input array are returned as NaNs.

    """
    Partition array elements along given axis.

    A 1d array B is partitioned at array index kth if three conditions are met:
        (1) B[kth] is in its sorted position,
        (2) all elements to the left of kth are less than or equal to B[kth],
        (3) all elements to the right of kth are greater than or equal to B[kth].

    Note that the array elements in conditions (2) and (3) are in general unordered.

    Shuffling the input array may change the output.

    The only guarantee is given by the three conditions above.

    This functions is not protected against NaN.

    Therefore, you may get unexpected results if the input contains NaN.

    ### Parameters:

        aarray_like
            Input array.
            If a is not an array, a conversion is attempted.

        kthint
            The value of the element at index kth will be in its sorted position.
            Smaller (larger) or equal values will be to the left (right) of index kth.

        axis{int, None}, optional
            Axis along which the partition is performed.
            The default (axis=-1) is to partition along the last axis.

    ### Returns:

        yndarray
            A partitioned copy of the input array with the same shape and type of a.

    ### Notes

        Unexpected results may occur if the input array contains NaN.

    ### Examples

    Create a numpy array:

    >>> a = np.array([1, 0, 3, 4, 2])

    Partition array so that the first 3 elements (indices 0, 1, 2) are the smallest 3 elements (note, as in this example, that the smallest 3 elements may not be sorted):

    >>> bn.partition(a, kth=2)
    array([1, 0, 2, 4, 3])

    A 1d array B is partitioned at array index kth if three conditions are met:

        (2) all elements to the left of kth are less than or equal to B[kth],

    ### Parameters:

        aarray_like
            Input array.
            If a is not an array, a conversion is attempted.

        kthint
            The value of the element at index kth will be in its sorted position.

        axis{int, None}, optional

            The default (axis=-1) is to partition along the last axis.

    ### Returns:

        yndarray
            An array the same shape as the input array containing the indices that partition a.
            The dtype of the indices is numpy.intp.

    ### Notes

    Unexpected results may occur if the input array contains NaN.

    ### Examples

    Create a numpy array:

    >>> a = np.array([10, 0, 30, 40, 20])

    Find the indices that partition the array so that the first 3 elements are the smallest 3 elements:

    >>> index = bn.argpartition(a, kth=2)
    >>> index
    array([0, 1, 4, 3, 2])

    Letâ€™s use the indices to partition the array (note, as in this example, that the smallest 3 elements may not be in order):

    array([10, 0, 20, 40, 30])

    Fill missing values (NaNs) with most recent non-missing values.

    Filling proceeds along the specified axis from small index values to large index values.

    ### Parameters:

        aarray_like
            Input array.
            If a is not an array, a conversion is attempted.

        n{int, None}, optional
            How far to push values.
            If the most recent non-NaN array element is more than n index positions away, than a NaN is returned.
            The default (n = None) is to push the entire length of the slice.
            If n is an integer it must be nonnegative.

        axisint, optional
            Axis along which the elements of the array are pushed.
            The default (axis=-1) is to push along the last axis of the input array.

    ### Returns:

        yndarray
